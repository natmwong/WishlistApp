## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
There was an issue when I first ran the app that it was only showing the store URL for the first item in the RecyclerView.
However, I fixed the issue easily by deleting two lines in the RecyclerView which were constraintHorizontal_bias and constraintVertical_bias.
